        "LibroShare is a full‑stack web application where students and library users can list study rooms they control (e.g., private rooms in a university library), and any registered user can browse, search, filter, and book those rooms for a specific date and time slot. The platform automatically prevents double‑booking using time‑conflict detection, allows room owners to manage their listings, and gives every user a dashboard to handle their own bookings. Secure JWT authentication is stored in HTTP‑only cookies, and the whole site is responsive and recruiter‑friendly.",
